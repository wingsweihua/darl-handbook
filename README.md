# 👋 Welcome!

{% hint style="info" %}
**About this template:** This is An Internal Wiki to lay out everything anyone needs to know about our lab, and help others get to know our team and research better.
{% endhint %}

This set of documents is not generally kept updated. Some parts of it have been redacted. The handbook is provided for informational purposes only, with the goal of helping researchers to improve their lab documentation. If you find our handbook useful, please get in touch on Twitter: [@realhuawei ](https://twitter.com/realhuawei)

For **new team members**, this space will be helpful during your first days with the team, to better learn about who we are and how we work.

For **long-time team members**, this space will act as a reminder and allow you to find answers about admin and policies etc.

<summary>How to use it?</summary>

This space is designed to be read linearly, so start with our Vision, Mission, & Focus and work down from there! We recommend reading everything through in one sitting and then revisiting and re-reading if you need to. You can also do "searching" or chat with the [AI Bot](https://app.aiml.asu.edu/38da6ee238e6433aa7b8de6fb98056ca) that Hua built.

# 👔 Attending Conferences

From time to time, we can fund students' travel to conferences to present research. This funding is generally reserved for senior thesis students, grad students, postdocs, and staff, but exceptions can be made. **If you have papers accepted, you should always try applying for travel grants from your conference > SCAI > our group**.



Before the conference:

* [ ] Settle down all the money issues
* [ ] One month before the conference, prepare your slides and posters for the presentation.&#x20;
  * [ ] Bring your slides to your individual meeting with Hua and arrange for a presentation
* [ ] Two weeks before the conference, finalize your posters and prepare to print - and you need to bring them back after the conference
* [ ] Three days before the conference, browse through the agenda, marked out the talks and sessions that interest you

During the conference

* [ ] Present your work and mark down the questions asked by the audience
* [ ] Stay there the whole time for your poster presentation
* [ ] Meet any many people as possible, ask questions during other people's talk, talk to people, and keep their contacts

After the conference

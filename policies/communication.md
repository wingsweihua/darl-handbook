# 📞 Communication

Because our lab has a very wide variety of projects that span across departments, universities, and time zones, keeping in touch with one another in a supportive and productive fashion may be the most important thing that we do.

{% hint style="info" %}
A guiding principle about our communication is that you should **be vocal.** If you need something, ask! If you don't understand something, ask! If you want to start a new project, ask! It is **ALWAYS** better to ask more questions than fewer questions.
{% endhint %}

Our primary means of communication is Slack, but we also talk with the outside world via email, phone, and social media.

## Internal communication (Slack)

Our Slack workspace is shared with the Evolutionary Psychology Lab, and also has many guest members, outside collaborators, etc. You will encounter users on Slack who you haven't met in person. If you don't recognize a name/username, it's safest to assume they may be an external collaborator — please be mindful when posting.

You'll find that the vast majority of your work with us is coordinated through Slack, so it's important that everyone is on the same page about how we use it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
All lab members are required to **download the Slack app** to their computers and phones, and **enable notifications** during work hours. This is especially important because we have many collaborators who work in different time zones. We all need to be able to reach you quickly while you are at work.
{% endhint %}

### How and where to post

Every project gets its own channel (like `#ipl`). Some projects are large enough to require multiple channels (like `#tml` and its many channel-children, like `#tml-td` and `#tml-fc`).

In addition to project-specific channels, we have a variety of channels for organizational purposes.\
`#general` is where we share various thoughts and ideas across the Music Lab and EPL, along with interesting new papers, and lab-wide announcements (including lab meeting info).\
`#musiclab` is where we share posts that are specific to Music Lab members (and not necessarily relevant to other members of the workspace).\
`#musiclab-babytimes` is for info regarding scheduling infants for studies (e.g. checking to see if anyone can run a baby after-hours/on the weekend).\
`#musiclab-status` is where, at the start of each work day, we each post a quick overview of what we plan on working on for the day.

You'll get the hang of what goes where, and if you post something in a funny place, typically an admin will remove it or ask you to repost it elsewhere.

### Joining new channels

When you start working on a project, usually Hua or a lab manager will add you to one or more corresponding channels. You'll see these appear in the sidebar on Slack.

You can also join channels on your own: by default, most of our project channels are public, so that anyone in the lab can join them and read up on what's happening. This is intentional! You should always feel free to explore the public channels (click the + next to Channels to see what's available!)

{% hint style="info" %}
**We encourage all lab members to lurk!** Following progress on a channel is a great way to get involved with a project.
{% endhint %}

### Making things visible

You'll find that **almost all messages you write on Slack should be in a channel, and not in a Direct Message**. This is because Slack's value is in its search functions: they make it easy to find messages about a particular project long after they have been posted. This only works well if messages are grouped in the right channels, by projects; we can't search each other's direct messages.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Direct messages should **only** be used for confidential conversations (like advising discussions with Sam) or for incidental messages that nobody else needs to read (like "are we skyping now?").
{% endhint %}

When in doubt, post something publicly, so that anybody with something useful to add can weigh in. Even if they don't need to weigh in, they'll see your messages and can keep up to date with what's going on.

### Getting people's attention

To tag specific people in posts, use `@username` to get their attention. Most people only get notifications for posts that include their name, so this can also be helpful if you want someone to weigh in on a particular thread (they might not have seen it at all if they weren't tagged.)

In the Music Lab, we are **active nudgers**. We've got a lot going on in lab, which means that we miss messages now and then! It's nothing personal.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need a response and haven't got one, it is **always okay** to re-reply to a thread, tagging whoever's attention you need. "hey `@username` just bumping this" is always an appropriate thing to post, for all lab members, including Sam!
{% endhint %}

### Acknowledging tasks and saying when things are done

One limitation of online communication is that it's sometimes hard to tell if everyone is on the same page. We make liberal use of `/giphy` (try it) and emoji to make sure we get the message across — when a decision is reached, don't exit the conversation until you say 👍or "got it" or the like.

This is also true for tasks that take a few days. Whenever you _finish_ doing something, make sure you post on Slack so that whoever needs to know that you're finished actually knows. When people forget to do this, it introduces a delay: a couple of days' time when you're finished but nobody knows about it is wasted, when it could be used to move on to the next steps.

### Expectations

We do not impose any lab-wide rule about the times we expect each other to be available to respond to messages. This is because we are mindful of the fact that different people keep different schedules. Some of your labmates work from 9-5 and not outside those hours. Others work just as many hours but at other times of day, on the weekend, and so on, and many of our collaborators (students included) are in different time zones.

We expect you to be aware of your labmates' preferences in this regard — especially those labmates with whom you work most closely — to ensure both that we get our work done efficiently and that nobody feels they are being pressured to work at different times than they'd like to. If you run into any issues with this, please chat with Hua or a lab manager about it.

### Don't forget to log out

Slack is often used on shared computers. **Always log out of your Slack session when you leave a shared computer.** This is important because direct messages and private channels may contain confidential information (especially for senior members of the lab), proprietary research materials, or both. If you open Slack and find someone else's account logged in, please log out immediately.

**Never share any of your lab credentials with anyone.** This includes ALL credentials: Slack, Google Drive, Handbook, Overleafs, lab computers, etc.

You can set up two-factor authentication on your Slack account to reduce the likelihood that someone logs in as you by mistake, if you like. We do not require this of all lab members, but recommend it for grad students, postdocs, and staff.

## External communication

Communicating to people outside the lab is **extremely important**: your actions reflect not only on yourself, but on the lab, the PI, the department, and the university. This is true both for participants (who volunteer for our studies) and scientific colleagues (whose opinions have a direct impact on our success and opportunity — they are the ones reviewing our grants and papers).

It is essential that every time one of us represents the lab externally, it is with professionalism and courtesy.

### Email

In general, you will not need to send emails to lab members — Slack replaces email. However, when working with other members of the department who are not part of our workspace, or with outside collaborators who have not yet joined our workspace, you'll occasionally be copied on email threads. Please always use your Harvard email, if you have one.

{% hint style="info" %}
If we need to discuss the contents of an email thread, rather than doing it by email, forward the message to Slack so that we can open a thread about it there. You can do so by forwarding the message to **\[redacted]** or using one of the [Slack email add-ons.](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/slack-tips/send-email-to-slack)
{% endhint %}

We also use email to communicate with families participating in research. All such emails should be sent from **\[redacted].** If you are ever unsure of what to write to a parent, **always** ask for help.

### Phone

If the phone rings while you're in the lab, answer it. Identify the lab and your name. "Thanks for calling the DaRL Lab, this is \[your name], how may I help you?" is a good start. Remember that parents of infants are often in noisy environments, so it's a good idea to speak slowly and clearly.

Check voicemail daily to make sure that any calls from research participants are answered promptly. Voicemail messages should always be returned within one business day.

### Social media

We try to be as active as possible on social media. The credentials for lab-wide social media accounts are in [Resources](broken-reference); if you are new to the lab, be sure to discuss with a lab manager before you start posting from them.

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to lab accounts, you are more than welcome to use your personal social media accounts to discuss our research — so long as that engagement is positive!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
When you share an article, please update **\[redacted]** with a URL to the relevant item and the date it was posted. This is so we can keep track of what has already been posted to avoid repetitive posts.
{% endhint %}

#### Rules for what to post

* **Never** post a picture of a participant without the explicit permission of the participant, or if the participant is a minor, teenager, or needs guardian.&#x20;
* Keep it positive and do not post any profanity!
* Consider your audience & platform before posting, and if appropriate, post the same item across multiple platforms

#### Ideas for posting

* Photos, videos, media are usually better than plain text
* Hashtags, links, and emoji are great additions too
* Common topics:
  * Introductions for new lab members (sometimes these are baby pics)
  * Accomplishments/events (e.g. if the music lab is giving a talk/poster at a conference, a paper comes out, etc.)
  * Posts about current music-related events
  * Articles: media coverage of lab related research, affiliate research, or topics we care about (infants, music, sound, etc.)
  * Updates about [https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/hw/](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/hw/)
  * Photos of babies that participated in studies and whose parents gave us permission to post on social media
  * Photos advertising new studies in the lab
  * Photos of Theo, our Chief Pilot Subject (ask Sam)

# 📑 Paper Writing

* As a leading author, please highlight everyone’s contribution in time (not right before paper submission) so others know they have actually contributed along the way - that’s teamwork.&#x20;
  * Also, if you contributed to anyone’s project, ask them to recognize your contribution in time if they did not.
* **Once a plan for submission to a conference is confirmed**, the (lead) student should create an **overleaf** and invite immediately to Hua as a co-owner of the overleaf project. &#x20;
* **14 days before the deadline**, a manuscript should be ready for collaborating students to review.
  * The lead author should read the requirements (call for papers) and **create a submission on the conference submission site** - this is very important since some conference has abstract submission deadlines.  The submission is not necessarily an ideal version)
  * Within the 14 days, the lead author should make sure **there is at least one thorough read of the manuscript per day**. This could be done collaboratively by different people across different days.&#x20;
* **7 days before the deadline**, the manuscript should be ready for Hua to review. At this time：
  * All typos and obvious errors should be eliminated.
  * The main form of the figures and tables should be finalized.
  * The number of pages for the main body should be finalized.&#x20;
    * Page shrinking tips:
      * [ ] Shrink the lines with only one word.
      * [ ] Shink the Table/Figures while making sure it's readable on the A4 page.
      * [ ] `\vspace{}` should be the **last thing** you use to shrink your number of pages.&#x20;
  * Based on the quality of the manuscript, Hua is likely to organize an **internal paper review session** with invited participants (group members, collaborating faculties, or other people).
    * One day before the review session, the lead author should send out a pdf version to everyone.&#x20;
      * Invited participants have to read the papers (in a **paper version**) before the meeting and bring the commented papers to the session.&#x20;
        * During the meeting, every participant will point out the problems to the authors.
* **During the last week before the deadline**, based on the quality of the manuscript, Hua is able to provide one version of feedback per day. **To make full use of Hua and the review session, the authors are expected to finish the revision within 12 hours after receiving the feedback.**
* **Two days before the deadline**, the authors can request Hua for additional help on paper.&#x20;
* One day before the deadline, fix all the errors and warnings in Overleaf. Sometimes the warnings include duplicate definitions of a label, this could cause wrong references for figures/tables.
* **One hour before the deadline**, finish the following checklist:
  * [ ] Shorten the sentence so that there isn't just one word in a line. (缩短句子，让一行里不要只有一个词)
  * [ ] Run a Grammarly/ChatGpt check to catch typos. (grammarly check一遍typo)
  * [ ] Verify all abbreviations to ensure their full forms are provided before their first usage. (检查所有的缩写，第一次出现之前是不是有全称)
    * [ ] Remember, in formal writing, "can't" cannot be abbreviated; it should be written as "cannot" without a space between "can" and "not".  (Can't不能缩写，要写成cannot)
  * [ ] Review all headings to ensure consistent capitalization rules are applied for headings of the same level. (检查所有的标题，是不是同一级别的标题使用同样的大小写规则)
  * [ ] All parentheses/literature citations/cross-references should have a space before them, created using the "\~" symbol in latex. (所有的括号/文献引用/图表交叉引用前面都要有空格，在Latex里符号生成空格)
  * [ ] Pictures and tables are the most critical components of an article and often the first things people look at. Review all tables, images, and their corresponding captions to ensure readers can understand the conclusions by looking at them alone. Suggest including the conclusions in the titles of experimental results. (图片和表格是文章最重要的部分，是很多人第一眼先看的东西。检查所有的表格、图片和对应标题，是不是可以使读者单看图片、表格和标题就可以看到结论。建议实验结果的标题里写上结论)
  * [ ] Please check the punctuation in the following areas (检查图表题头和公式后的标点符号):
    * Table captions
    * Figure captions
    * After equations
  * [ ] Check for the consistent use of "Figure/Fig." "Section/Sec." and "Equation/Eq." (检查Figure/Fig.， Section/Sec.， Equation/Eq.的统一使用)
  * [ ] Before the final submission, run another Grammarly/ChatGPT check and search for "?" to check for citation failures or exceeding page limits. (最后交之前搜索“？”查看是否有引用失败，是否超页数)
  * [ ] For conferences requiring separate submissions, you can download the whole file as PDF and duplicate the PDF file into two files: one for paper submission and one for appendix, then delete certain pages with "Adobe - organize pages" or "MacOS Preview - Delete" (如果遇到Appendix和正文分开交的情况，可以先下载整体PDF， copy两份，再使用Adobe或者Mac自带的PDF编辑工具删除对应页面得到正文和Appendix两个文件)&#x20;
* After submission (you should submit it at least 1 hour before the deadline), download your submission from the submission site and check the following:
  * Do the pages exceed the requirements?
  * Does the appendix satisfy the requirements?
* One week after the submission deadline, you should write a blog when your mind still remembers it. Details can be found in [Paper Maintaining](paper-maintainance.md).

# 📑 Paper Writing

* **Once a plan for submission to a conference is confirmed**, the (lead) student should create an **overleaf** and invite immediately to Hua as a co-owner of the overleaf project. &#x20;
* **14 days before the deadline**, a manuscript should be ready for collaborating students to review.
  * The lead author should read the requirements (call for papers) and **create a submission on the conference submission site** - this is very important since some conference has abstract submission deadlines.  The submission is not necessarily an ideal version)
  * Within the 14 days, the lead author should make sure **there is at least one thorough read of the manuscript per day**. This could be done collaboratively by different people across different days.&#x20;
* **7 days before the deadline**, the manuscript should be ready for Hua to review. At this time：
  * All typos and obvious errors should be eliminated.
  * The main form of the figures and tables should be finalized.
  * Based on the quality of the manuscript, Hua is likely to organize an **internal paper review session** with invited participants (group members, collaborating faculties, or other people).
    * One day before the review session, the lead author should send out a pdf version to everyone.&#x20;
      * Invited participants have to read the papers (in a **paper version**) before the meeting and bring the commented papers to the session.&#x20;
        * During the meeting, every participant will point out the problems to the authors.
* **During the last week before the deadline**, based on the quality of the manuscript, Hua is able to provide one version of feedback per day. **To make full use of Hua and the review session, the authors are expected to finish the revision within 12 hours after receiving the feedback.**
* **Two days before the deadline**, the authors can request Hua for additional help on paper.&#x20;
* One day before the deadline, fix all the errors and warnings in Overleaf. Sometimes the warnings include duplicate definitions of a label, this could cause wrong references for figures/tables.
* **One hour before the deadline**, finish the following checklist:
  * [ ] Run a Grammarly/ChatGpt check to catch typos. (grammarly check一遍typo)
  * [ ] Verify all abbreviations to ensure their full forms are provided before their first usage. (检查所有的缩写，第一次出现之前是不是有全称)
  * [ ] Review all headings to ensure consistent capitalization rules are applied for headings of the same level. (检查所有的标题，是不是同一级别的标题使用同样的大小写规则)
  * [ ] All parentheses/literature citations/cross-references should have a space before them, created using the "\~" symbol in latex. (所有的括号/文献引用/图表交叉引用前面都要有空格，在Latex里符号生成空格)
  * [ ] Review all tables, images, and their corresponding captions to ensure readers can understand the conclusions by looking at them alone. Suggest including the conclusions in the titles of experimental results. (检查所有的表格、图片和对应标题，是不是可以使读者单看图片、表格和标题就可以看到结论。建议实验结果的标题里写上结论)
  * [ ] Before the final submission, run another Grammarly check and search for "?" to check for citation failures or exceeding page limits. (最后交之前搜索“？”查看是否有引用失败，是否超页数)
  * [ ] For conferences requiring separate submissions, you can download the whole file as PDF and duplicate the PDF file into two files: one for paper submission and one for appendix, then delete certain pages with "Adobe - organize pages" or "MacOS Preview - Delete"&#x20;
* After submission (you should submit it at least 1 hour before the deadline), download your submission from the submission site and check the following:
  * Do the pages exceed the requirements?
  * Does the appendix satisfy the requirements?
* One week after the submission deadline, you should write a blog when your mind still remembers it. Details can be found in [Paper Maintaining](paper-maintainance.md).

### Guidelines for Regular Research Presentations and Feedback

As members of our lab, we believe that active engagement with the research community and regular feedback are essential for academic and professional growth. To foster a culture of collaboration, learning, and improvement, we emphasize the importance of regular research presentations and discussions. Here are the suggested guidelines for presenting your work and seeking feedback:

1. **Check-in with Graduate Student Mentors**: If you are working on a project with a graduate student mentor, communicate with them frequently. They are valuable resources who can provide guidance and help navigate challenges you may encounter.
2. **Engage in Informal Discussions**: Take advantage of opportunities to have lunch or engage in informal discussions about your work with peers and colleagues. These interactions allow you to exchange ideas, learn from others' perspectives, and expand your understanding of different research approaches.
3. **Present to Advisors**: Present your progress and findings to your advisors at least every other week. This regular communication ensures that you receive timely feedback, clarify any uncertainties, and stay on track with your research goals.
4. **Lab Group Presentations**: Present your work to the lab group at least once a semester. Sharing your research within the group promotes collaboration, fosters a supportive environment, and encourages interdisciplinary discussions.
5. **Departmental Presentations**: Present your work to the department at least once a year, preferably once a semester. This showcases your research to a broader audience, invites diverse perspectives, and strengthens your professional network within the department.
6. **Participate in Informal Settings**: Engage in discussions or present your work in informal settings such as reading groups or small seminars at least twice a semester. These smaller group settings provide opportunities for in-depth discussions, constructive criticism, and refining your ideas.

We recognize that regular presenting may seem demanding, but we believe it is instrumental in your development as a researcher. It not only enhances the quality of your work but also cultivates valuable skills in communication, critical thinking, and collaboration. Embrace the opportunity to share your research, seek feedback, and contribute to the vibrant research community within our lab and department.

Remember, feedback is the fastest path to improvement and success in your research endeavors.

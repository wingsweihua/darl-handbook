# 🐦 Hello, DaRL!

If you are new here, this is the very first steps you need to do:

* [ ] Ensuring that both you and your labmates have familiarized yourselves with our lab policies is crucial. ~~To establish this shared understanding, please **post the following message to #darllab-status on Trello after reviewing the**~~ [~~**Lab Policies**~~](/broken/pages/hgdOouVcUq6nmLcwFEux) ~~**section**~~. If you have any queries about the policies, feel free to ask before making the post.
  * > I have read and understand all the Lab Policies. I agree to abide by them at all times while working in or collaborating with the DaRL Lab.&#x20;
* [ ] Check whether you have access to the following channels and resources for[ project management](../policies/project-management.md). We use Email and Slack for communication, Google Drive for archiving, and sometimes (rarely) phone calls for emergencies. **You should ask Hua for their links when you join the group**.
  * [ ] Email for official communications and letters
  * [ ] ~~Trello Dashboard for project manegement updates~~
  * [ ] Slack for research sharing and notices
  * [ ] Google Drive:
    * [ ] Shared folder for paper sharing and reviewing
    * [ ] A Personal folder for personal updates
  * [ ] Building access: Submit your request [here](https://ets.engineering.asu.edu/keyless-door-entry-system-isaac/).
* [ ] Set up your calendars on [your phone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-multiple-calendars-iph3d1110d4/ios) or Outlook, mark all the next three meetings on your calendar, and set up reminders for those meetings.
* [ ] Have a [well-structured personal website](https://academicpages.github.io/) and ask Hua to link you on his website.&#x20;
* [ ] Commit a GitHub merge request to [this repo](https://github.com/wingsweihua/darl-handbook) and add yourself on the [meet-the-team.md](../team/meet-the-team.md "mention") page.
* [ ] Once you have something indexed or published, create and maintain a **Google scholar page**. You can link to your co-authors accounts and follow other accounts.
* [ ] Maintain an up-to-date CV on your primary, personal machine but ensure that a current copy is also stored in the CV folder in the lab Google Drive (don't know where it is? Ask a senior lab member), so that it can be used by Hua for reference.
* [ ] Read the[ required readings](../resources/readings.md) in time
* [ ] L~~ook over the list of ongoing projects on the Trello board of `darl-status`~~&#x20;

### OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER

* Think about creating a Twitter account even if you don't do anything publicly for a while. Follow ASU faculty, other early-career grad students,  and scholars working in the research areas you're interested in.&#x20;
* If you have anything you can present at a conference, it is in your best interest to apply for ASU's travel grant first.

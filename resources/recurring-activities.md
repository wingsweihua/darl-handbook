# ⌚ Recurring activities

## Daily checklist

These tasks should be split among all the RAs working on a given day. It is your responsibility to ensure that they are all done every day.

* [ ] Spend a few minutes on social media
  * [ ] Reply/RT/Like any posts mentioning our lab members online
  * [ ] Reply to any questions, thank people for shares, repost hype, etc.
  * [ ] Post something new **every day**. Check out #socialmedia and chat with your labmates for ideas. You can schedule posts for your LinkedIn or Twitter.
* [ ] Read 3 papers a day, you could choose any paper that interests you, going viral right now or is related to your research, hopefully from top conferences/journals or research groups.
* [ ] Read and respond to any new bug reports from GitHub

## Meetings & seminars

### 🤝 Weekly Syncs

Lab meetings are usually held weekly or biweekly. Graduate students, lab staff, and undergraduate students taking research for credit are expected to attend all lab meetings and to arrive prepared (i.e., having read any assigned papers before the lab meeting). If you can't attend a meeting, you must let Hua know ahead of time. Lab meeting topics (including any readings) will be announced weekly in advance via Slack `#sharing` .

We typically use lab meetings to get feedback on new research ideas or a manuscript in progress, practice for an upcoming talk, or discuss a paper. Grad students, postdocs, and thesis students are required to present in lab meetings regularly. RAs are not required to do so, but they can give a project idea or a good suggestion for a discussion topic.

**Information on the lab meeting date, time, and topic is posted in #sharing on Slack.**

### ☕️ Zoom or in-person Coffee Chat

We meet once a month for coffee for whoever is open and interested or whoever fancies a chat!

### :bow\_and\_arrow:Start of Semester Planning Meeting

Each student is expected to plan his semester and meet with Hua about it before the end of the first two weeks of the semester.&#x20;

### 🎲 Team Event

As we don't want to wait for our next offsite to spend some quality time together and sparkle our days, we're trying to organize team events on a regular basis.

### 🌍 Offsites

Every few months we arrange a group offsite so we can all meet face-to-face.

### Departmental Seminars

During the semester, there are many talks in SCAI that we encourage all lab members to attend. You can sign up to receive talk announcements for each individual seminar at the links below, and whenever there is a particularly good talk, we will post it on #sharing. Most of these seminars also offer free food!

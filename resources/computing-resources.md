# 🖥️ Computing Resources



University Research Computing Clusters - Agave and SOL:&#x20;

{% embed url="https://asurc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/overview" %}

Our lab also has [a handbook for Sol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D6L-4DXM2yxBKRDxXdiYPm7r9qOjaqc-a\_Vm6pnq\_ng/edit?usp=sharing) (thanks to Kuan-Ru and TJ!)&#x20;

* If you have any feedback, please let Kuan-Ru and TJ know.



Each student should be able to access one desktop machine in the lab. If you need one desktop specifically for you, please send a quote of your needs to Hua.

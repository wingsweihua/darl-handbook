# 5 Questions for Introduction (or any research)

1. What is the problem?
2. Why is it interesting and important?
3. Why is it hard? (e.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
5. What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.

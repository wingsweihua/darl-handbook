# 5 Questions for Introduction (or any research)

Introduction is a longer version of the abstract, i.e. of the entire paper and it is the most creative part of your paper writing, it requires storytelling skills that might need years to develop. But if you don't know how to tell a story about your research, the following structure is a baseline:



1. What is the problem? \[What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?]
2. Why is it interesting and important?
3. Why is it hard? (e.g., why do naive approaches fail?) \[Can use example]
4. Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
5. How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!) -> which part corresponding to which challenge. What are the key components of my approach and results?&#x20;
6. How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)
7. New trend: specifically list your contributions as bullet points
8. Extra space? Future work and any specific limitations.

# Drafting Posters

Creating posters for conference presentations requires careful planning and design. Here are some steps to help you make an effective poster:

1. Organize Information: Structure your poster into clear sections, such as Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion. Make sure the flow is logical and easy to follow.
   * Good examples of posters.
   * Formats of posters in pptx: [FURI format](https://libguides.asu.edu/furi/poster), [ASU format](https://conhi.asu.edu/tab/templates),[ Rutgers format.](https://aresty.rutgers.edu/resources/students/poster-design-and-printing/research-poster-templates)
   * Size and Format: Check the conference guidelines for poster size and format requirements. Typically, posters are designed in landscape orientation.
2. Branding: Include the title of your research, your name, affiliation, and contact information. Add logos or branding elements if required.
3. Use Clear and Concise Text: Keep your text brief and to the point. Use bullet points, short sentences, and avoid lengthy paragraphs.
   * Choose Appropriate Fonts: Use legible fonts that are easy to read from a distance. Avoid using too many font styles and sizes.
   * Balance White Space: Don't overcrowd your poster; leave enough white space to maintain a clean and organized look.
4. Use Visuals: Incorporate visuals like graphs, charts, images, and diagrams to represent your data and findings. Visuals make your poster more engaging and easier to understand.
   * Use Colors Wisely: Choose a color scheme that is visually appealing and complements your content. Avoid using too many colors, as it may distract from the main message.
5. Print and Mount: Choose high-quality printing to ensure clear images and text. Mount the poster on a sturdy board for display.
6. Practice: Be prepared to explain your poster to attendees. Practice your presentation to be confident and articulate during the conference.

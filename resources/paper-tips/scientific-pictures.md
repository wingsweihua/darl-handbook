# Scientific Pictures

The easiest way to draw pictures in your paper, is imitation.&#x20;

* Firstly, you need to know what you will draw and what is the caption and conclusion you want to convey in the picture.&#x20;
* Look at the related work in your paper, glancing through every picture with a question in your mind: "can I use this picture (roughly) to illustrate my caption/conclusion?" Have at least two candidate pictures to refer.
* Draw a sketch with your pen, mimicking the referred pictures and modify to suit your need.
* Show your sketch to your co-authors with referred original pictures.
* Draw it.&#x20;

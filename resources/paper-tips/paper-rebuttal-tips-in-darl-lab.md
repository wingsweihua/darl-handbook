# Paper rebuttal tips in DaRL Lab

**Overall idea of the rebuttal:**

1. Highlight that the flaws in the paper can be improved and emphasize the significant contributions of the paper.
2. Convince the Area Chair (AC) to accept the paper and reject unhelpful review comments.
3. Maintain a positive attitude, with multiple rounds of responses and rebuttals if necessary.
4. If there are conflicting comments on the same point, encourage reviewers to discuss with each other to gain support.
5. Avoid directly admitting to problems; instead, explain why a particular approach was taken while acknowledging the value of the comment.
6. Use respectful language, framing "mistakes" as "misunderstandings."

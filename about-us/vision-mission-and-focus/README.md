Who are we and where are we from

The DaRL Lab was created with the startup funding from NJIT and then a grant from the NSF CRII Award. You can read Hua's proposal for this grant. We also have a small grant from the DoE.

* We are a relatively young lab, so we are still figuring things out. If something about how the lab runs seems weird to you and/or if you think of a way we could improve something, **say something**! An organization's culture and practices can only improve via regular feedback from its members.
* We are a "flow" lab: we have plenty of interns flowing around and are not a permanent part of the lab. At some point, our specific research directions may switch as well. Don't worry, as a flow, it's never gonna be a hard switch. Hua will keep you posted if something like this is in the works!
